# 1. Complementary DNA

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

Example: (input --> output)

"ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
"GTAT" --> "CATA"

Don't forget to add spaces.

# 3. Counting and Grouping
